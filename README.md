  ## Installation
  The user must have `Node.js` already installed on their local device. 
  
  After cloning or downloading the repository from GitHub, users open the file(s) in their Visual Studio Code or other editor, and run `node index.js` from the command line.


  ## Usage
  Make sure to run `npm install` in the terminal command line before typing `node index.js` to initialize the application. 
  
  **Make sure you are in the root directory of the file before initializing or else the program will not run.** 
  
  * Once the welcome message is displayed, enter information following each prompt for Manager, then add an Engineer, Intern, or select Done. 
  
  * Once "Done" is selected from the menu prompt, a unique team profile will be created and available for use. Located in the /dist folder, it will be named `index.html`.

  ## Contributions
  Viewers can fork the repository, or download and create their own changes to prompts, css, or whatever! Comments, suggestions, or feedback can be submitted to me via the links below.


  ## Test
  Make sure to install Jest.js -- if you make any changes to the application, you may add tests to the `__tests__` folder and subsequent files. To test, type `npm run test`, or `npm test` from the command line. 
  
  * To target a specific suite, type that name following `npm test`. If the test(s) pass, you will see all green and check marks; if they fail, you will see red and messages that will direct you to the errors that need addressing.
